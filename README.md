# Clocks
 
Using OOP, I took JS30's base day 2 files, in which we created an analogue clock, complete with rotating clock hand animations. I then converted that aanlogue clock to a digital format (24-hour time), and created muiltiple clock objects. The next goal is to update those same objects to a single class and automate the "clockType" to cycle though pre-determined values (UTC, JST, EST, etc.) instead of hard coding using if statements.
